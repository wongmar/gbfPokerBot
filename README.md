# gbfPokerBot

This project is for learning how to utilize image recognition. I chose to make a poker bot for the game Granblue Fantasy as a way of having a specific goal.

Currently I am utilizing OpenCV and Pattern Matching in order to find the location and identity of each card that is shown on the screen. 

Current Issues: Unable to detect cards when they change in size.
